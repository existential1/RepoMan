Basic Web Form Tests
--------------------

The following two Basic Web Form test cases have been developed in support of the Coding Exercise:

1. TestBasicWebFormPositive; and 
2. TestBasicWebFormNegative

Test case automation was accomplished utilizing the Ruby Test::Unit framework and Selenium WebDriver. Tests were validated against the Firefox browser with the browser and and tests running on the same host machine. Given that aside from the tools and environment to be utilized for test construction/automation no other constraints were specified with respect to web page element manipulation and/or input data validity, the following assumptions were made:

1. The current web page implementation with respect to input field data restriction/validation and requirements necessary for successful submission of the form is correct;
2. All text input field elements are capable of accepting both alphanumeric and special characters;
3. The "Name" input field has no constraints with respect to name length or format other than that the length must be greater than zero (whitespace counts) ; and,
4. Either one or both of the check boxes associated with the "Do you like development?" question may be selected and will be accepted as satisying the associated form submission requirement.

The specifics with respect to the scenarios addressed in each of the test cases are as follows:

TestBasicWebFormPositive
------------------------

Given that the web form contains four possible input fields/items and that the only restriction with respect to successful form submission is the completion of the name field and development question item

Scenario 1
When I enter one character into the Name field, select the positive response to the development question, and press the Submit button
Then the form submission should be successful and the submission response page should be displayed

Scenario 2
When I enter several alphanumeric and special characters into the Name field, select the negative response to the development question, and press the Submit button
Then the form submission should be successful and the submission response page should be displayed

Scenario 3
When I enter only special characters into the Name field, select the positive and negative responses to the development question, and press the Submit button
Then the form submission should be successful and the submission response page should be displayed

Scenario 4
When I enter only whitespace characters into the Name field, select the positive response to the development question, and press the Submit button
Then the form submission should be successful and the submission response page should be displayed

Scenario 5
When I enter alpha characters only into the name field, select both the positive and negative response to the development question, select a preferred automated testing framework from the drop-down list, enter text into the comment field, and press the Submit button
Then the form submission should be successful and the submission response page should be displayed  

Succesful completion of each scenario was verified by asserting that the title of the web page displayed after selection of the Submit button was equal to "Thanks!".



TestBasicWebFormNegative
------------------------
Given that successful submission of the web form requires completion of the name field and selection of at least one of the responses to the development question

Scenario 1
When I attempt to submit the form without completing any of the form inputs 
Then the submission will be rejected, the submission response page will not be displayed, and I will remain on the same web page  

Scenario 2
When I attempt to submit the form after completing only the two optional input items 
Then the submission will be rejected, the submission response page will not be displayed, and I will remain on the same web page

Scenario 3
When I attempt to submit the form after completing only the Name field 
Then the submission will be rejected, the submission response page will not be displayed, and I will remain on the same web page 

Scenario 4
When I attempt to submit the form after only selecting the positive response to the development question 
Then the submission will be rejected, the submission response page will not be displayed, and I will remain on the same web page

Scenario 5
When I attempt to submit the form after only selecting the negative response to the development question 
Then the submission will be rejected, the submission response page will not be displayed, and I will remain on the same web page

Succesful completion of each scenario was verified by asserting that an attempt to locate the "Submit another response" link that resides on the response web page would raise an exception.
